Welcome to our NavLink 2 Developer's Guide (SDK) on GitHub. This guide is intended to help developers quickly get to grips with our NavLink 2 wireless NMEA2000 Gateway and implement it within their Apps.

The NavLink 2 wireless NMEA2000 Gateway is designed to allow an Application Developer to support bi-directional communication with an NMEA2000 network, through simple serial messages. Any individual or company that wishes to integrate NavLink 2 will need as a minimum the NMEA2000 Appendix A+B which is available from [http://nmea.org](http://nmea.org) for both NMEA members and non-members.

NavLink 2 is based on our existing iKonvert wired NMEA2000 gateway and they share the exact same serial protocol, so once you support one device, supporting the second is easy.
